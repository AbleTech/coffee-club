roast1:
  company: People's
  name: Don Wilfredo Espresso
  description: Our flagship blend is complex, a full bodied flavour juggernaught with chocolate sweetness and creamy caramel overtones. The 'Don' is roasted for espresso but also works well as a full-bodied plunger.

roast2:
  company: People's
  name: Colombia Popayan
  description: This washed coffee has a lovely upfront red apple sweetness with tropical overtones, matched with a raw sugar sweetness to form a rich complex coffee. The body of this coffee is clean, silky and full while still maintaining a pleasant apple acidity. This is a crowd pleaser coffee.

tairora:
  company: Cafe L'Affare
  name: Roasters' Cup - PNG Tairora
  description: The Roasters’ Cup is the epitome of the roasters’ craft, sourced from some of the world’s most interesting coffee plantations and roasted at our Auckland and Wellington cafes in small-batch roasters. These coffees are roasted light to medium by our roasters to heighten the unique and special characteristics that the varietal and location bring.
