  roastName: Colombia Popayan
  description: This washed coffee has a lovely upfront red apple sweetness with tropical overtones, matched with a raw sugar sweetness to form a rich complex coffee. The body of this coffee is clean, silky and full while still maintaining a pleasant apple acidity. This is a crowd pleaser coffee.
